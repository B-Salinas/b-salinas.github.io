# About Me

I'm known to many as simply "B", a childhood nickname that has stuck throughout my professional career.

I graduated from St. Edward's University with a B.S. in Mathematics. While I was not the greatest student in school (take a look at my [transcripts](/2019-05-Salinas-UnofficialTranscript.pdf)), I'm excited to finally understand math and its many applications in the software world.

I was a research and teaching assistant throughout college and spent my summers working for [BEAM](https://www.beammath.org/). After graduating, I worked with Travis County in Austin, TX as COVID-19 quickly shut down the world. Like many, I re-evaluated. Thankfully, I had the insight to look into software engineering bootcamps my senior year. I ended up academically failing out of [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/) on week 24 of 24, I took 10 months to get through the program. 

> These were my projects:
> + 1st Group Project: [Veni, Vidi, Voravi](https://github.com/rsdimatulac/Veni-Vidi-Voravi) with [S.S.](https://github.com/ssmall1), [R.D.](https://github.com/rsdimatulac), and [D.K.](https://github.com/hye-kim)
> + 1st Solo Project: [SoundTrack](https://github.com/B-Salinas/SoundTrack)
> + 2nd Group Project: [thrifTEE](https://github.com/vmeduri1/thrifTEE) with [V.M.](https://github.com/vmeduri1), [J.C.](https://github.com/Jc-008), and [N.O.](https://github.com/natoh19)
> + Final/Capstone Solo Project: [YGO Duel Academy Deck Builder](https://github.com/B-Salinas/YGO-Duel-Academy-Deck-Builder)

I learned _quite_ a lot during my time ☻

Since then, I've held jobs in:
+ Insurance
+ Finances + Wealth Management
+ Real Estate
+ Start Ups
+ Big Tech Companies
+ Food Industry
+ Customer Service

Here's a short run down of my latest positions.

> I was hit with both the 2022 and 2023 Layoffs in Tech. That really shook my spirit for a minute.

I'm grateful for every job I've held and what each position has taught me! ☺︎
